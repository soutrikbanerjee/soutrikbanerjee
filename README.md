ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @soutrikbanerjee
ðŸ‘€ This is my second profile, the other being https://github.com/mithua/
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested coding with Stata, Sas, R, Python, Matlab, Mathematica, SQL, MLwiN, BUGS, ....
ðŸ‘€ The open-source IDE's I prefer VS Code, RStudio (Posit), Jupyter, ....
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Julia, which is both an OOP & functional, line-interpreted & compiled language that has similarities in syntaxes with R, Python, Scala, Matlab, Mathematica among others. It is supposed to be very fast (C), with the ease of Python, & has the scientific prowess of R.
ðŸ‘€ The GUI-based statistical packages that I like are Statistica, JMP.
ðŸ‘€ Some other machine learning open-source software are Weka, Knime, Orange, Rapidminer.
ðŸ‘€ Some GIS tools are ArcGIS, SaTScan.
